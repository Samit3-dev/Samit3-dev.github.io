        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a Pakistani-American student with a strong interest in pursuing a career in the dental field.
            Growing up in a community where access to quality dental care is not always equitable has shaped my passion
            for improving oral health education and accessibility. I am currently a student at DeWitt Clinton High School
            and will graduate in 2026. Through my academic experiences and extracurricular involvement, I have developed
            a strong work ethic, leadership skills, and a commitment to serving others. My long-term goal is to become
            a dentist and work toward improving dental health systems in underserved communities.

    <h2>Reflection & Growth</h2>

    <p>
        My internship at CHOYCES LLC has helped me grow both personally and professionally.
        I learned how to work in a professional environment, communicate effectively,
        and take responsibility for my tasks. One challenge I faced was balancing multiple
        responsibilities, but I improved my time management and organization skills
        to meet expectations consistently.
    </p>

    <p>
        This experience connects directly to my future goals in the dental field because it
        reinforced the importance of service, leadership, and community impact.
        CHOYCES has strengthened my confidence and prepared me to pursue my long-term
        goal of becoming a dentist who makes a meaningful difference.
